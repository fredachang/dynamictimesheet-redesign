# time-tracker-app

The Time Tracker app is the first app I built using the React Typescript framework. The original idea was conceived at the start of my 3-4 month sabbatical of learning how to code, as a way to manage my time across different projects/goals. I wanted the experience of tracking time to be fun instead of invoking a feeling of obligation/ticking off boxes so I focused heavily on the UI.
